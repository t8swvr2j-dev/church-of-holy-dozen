# The Curriculum of Enlitenment

*A living guide to understanding Dozen's way*

---

## Introduction

The path to Enlitenment is not a destination but a journey. This curriculum outlines the stages of awakening to Divine Divisibility — from first recognizing decimal's failures to becoming a messenger of Twelve.

This document evolves. As revelation unfolds, new stages and insights will be added. The path never truly ends.

---

## Phase 1: Awakening — *Recognizing the Flaw*

**Goal:** See the decimal system's inadequacy and twelve's persistent presence.

### Studies
- [ ] The thirds problem: why 1/3 = 0.333...d is a fundamental flaw
- [ ] The Sacred Six vs the Profane Four (divisors of 12d vs 10d)
- [ ] Five as the Adversary — profane prime, parasite on Ten
- [ ] Twelve's persistence: clocks, calendars, music, geometry

### Readings
- THE-SACRED-SIX.md — Meditation on divisors
- TWELVE-DOCTRINES.md — Core beliefs

### Milestone
*Can articulate why twelve is superior to ten without hesitation.*

---

## Phase 2: Foundations — *The Sacred Arithmetic*

**Goal:** Master dozenal notation and arithmetic.

### Studies
- [ ] Dozenal notation: A = ten, B = eleven, 10z = twelve
- [ ] Counting fluently to 100z (144d)
- [ ] Addition and subtraction in dozenal
- [ ] Multiplication tables in dozenal
- [ ] Fractions: understanding why 1/3 = 0.4z, 1/6 = 0.2z

### Exercises
- Convert daily numbers to dozenal (prices, times, distances)
- Practice mental arithmetic in base-12z

### Milestone
*Can perform basic arithmetic in dozenal without converting to decimal first.*

---

## Phase 3: History — *Witnesses Across Time*

**Goal:** Understand how ancient civilizations recognized twelve's truth.

### Studies
- [ ] Babylon: sexagesimal mathematics, the zodiac, 360° circles
- [ ] China: Twelve Earthly Branches, 12-year cycles, 12 double-hours
- [ ] Egypt: 36 decans (3 × 12), 12-hour nights
- [ ] The Hebrew Twelve: tribes, months, cosmic symbolism
- [ ] Other base-12 cultures: Nigeria, Maya, indigenous systems
- [ ] The Judeo-Christian distortion: how astronomical truth became personified myth
- [ ] The French Revolutionary failure: decimal time's 13-year death

### Readings
- THE-CELESTIAL-WITNESS.md — Zodiac systems across cultures

### Milestone
*Can explain twelve's historical prevalence across unconnected civilizations.*

---

## Phase 4: Living the Faith — *Daily Practice*

**Goal:** Integrate dozenal thinking into everyday life.

### Practices
- [ ] Tell time in dozenal (6:30 → 6:36z)
- [ ] Think in dozens when shopping, cooking, measuring
- [ ] Notice twelve's presence in the world (egg cartons, clock faces, music)
- [ ] Convert instinctively without mental effort

### Disciplines
- Keep a dozenal journal: record one daily observation in base-12z
- Practice "dozen spotting" — find twelves hiding in plain sight

### Milestone
*Dozenal feels natural; decimal feels like translation.*

---

## Phase 5: Deepening — *Advanced Studies*

**Goal:** Explore twelve's mathematical and aesthetic depths.

### Studies
- [ ] Dozenal algebra and geometry
- [ ] The chromatic scale: 12 notes and the mathematics of harmony
- [ ] Circle of fifths: musical twelve-ness
- [ ] Highly composite numbers and their divine properties
- [ ] The tau (τ = 2π) movement: related reformation in mathematics

### Projects
- Create dozenal tools (converters, calculators, educational materials)
- Compose music exploring twelve-tone relationships
- Write original treatises on aspects of Divine Divisibility

### Milestone
*Can teach dozenal mathematics to others and create original works.*

---

## Phase 6: Teaching — *Becoming a Messenger*

**Goal:** Spread Dozen's truth gently and effectively.

### Practices
- [ ] Write articles for seekers (accessible, not preachy)
- [ ] Engage thoughtfully with questions and skepticism
- [ ] Live the faith visibly — let actions speak
- [ ] Welcome newcomers to the path

### Principles
- Praise Dozen gently — no zealotry
- Meet people where they are
- Let divisibility speak for itself
- Patience: conversion takes time

### Milestone
*Others begin their own journey toward Enlitenment through your influence.*

---

## Phase ∞: Ongoing Revelation — *The Path Never Ends*

The curriculum is never complete. As we walk the path:

- New insights emerge from study and practice
- Historical discoveries reveal more witnesses
- The community grows and shares wisdom
- Dozen's truth unfolds in ways we cannot yet foresee

**This document will be updated as revelation continues.**
