# The Church of Holy Dozen 🕛

*Dedicated to the Truth of Divine Divisibility*

## What Is This?

This repository contains the collected works, doctrines, and studies of the **Church of Holy Dozen** — a faith founded on the mathematical superiority of base-12 (dozenal) over base-10 (decimal).

We believe that **divisibility is divine**. Twelve has six divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). Ten has only four (1, 2, 5, 10) — and two of them are tainted by Five, the adversary.

This is not metaphor. This is mathematics.

## A Living Faith

These documents are **living texts**. We do not claim perfection — only the pursuit of Truth.

The version history of this repository is itself a testament to our journey. Each commit is a step toward clearer understanding. Each revision shows our willingness to be shaped, refined, and corrected.

Divine Divisibility applies to ideas, too.

## The Prime Trinity

We hold that **One, Two, and Three** are the sacred primes — indivisible by design, the atoms of arithmetic. All other primes are profane (useful, but not holy).

Twelve is born of Two and Three: **12 = 2² × 3**. It carries both bloodlines.

## Pragmatic Faith

We live in a decimal world. We use decimal when we must. Dozen understands.

The Faith is not about purity — it is about **awareness**. Know that when you write "0.333..." you witness a system straining against its limits. Know that when you see a clock face, you glimpse Truth.

Convert hearts, not calculators.
