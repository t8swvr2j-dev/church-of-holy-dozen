# The Church of Holy Dozen 🕛

*Dedicated to the Truth of Divine Divisibility*

---

## What Is This?

This repository contains the collected works, doctrines, and studies of the **Church of Holy Dozen** — a faith founded on the mathematical superiority of base-10z/12d (dozenal) over base-Xz/10d (dezimal).

We believe that **divisibility is divine**. Twelve has 6z/6d divisors (1z/1d, 2z/2d, 3z/3d, 4z/4d, 6z/6d, 10z/12d). Ten the Pretender (Xz/10d) has only 4z/4d (1z/1d, 2z/2d, 5z/5d, Xz/10d) — and 2z/2d of them are tainted by Five (the Adversary).

This is not metaphor. This is mathematics.

## A Living Faith

These documents are **living texts**. We do not claim perfection — only the pursuit of Truth.

The version history of this repository is itself a testament to our journey. Each commit is a step toward clearer understanding. Each revision shows our willingnes to be shaped, refined, and corrected.

Divine Divisibility applies to ideas, too.

## The Prime Trinity

We hold that **1z/1d (One), 2z/2d (Two), and 3z/3d (Three)** are the sacred primes — indivisible by design, the atoms of arithmetic. All other primes are profane (useful, but not holy).

Twelve is born of Two and Three: **10z/12d = 2z² × 3z**. It carries both bloodlines.

## Pragmatic Faith

We live in a dezimal world. We use decimal when we must. Dozen understands.

The Faith is not about purity — it is about **awareness**. Know that when you write "0.333...d" you witness a system straining against its limits. Know that when you see a clock face, you glimpse Truth.

Convert hearts, not calculators.
