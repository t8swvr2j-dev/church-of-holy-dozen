# Autumn Descent

*A nature poem — the turning of seasons*

---

Gold spills across the field, · the maples letting go.  
Each leaf that spirals down · adds to the burning floor.  
The oaks release their grip · on summer's fading warmth,  
and crows call out the change, · black wings against the fire.  

Fire lives in every hue · of amber, rust, and red.  
The forest is a forge · that shapes the dying year.  

Yet dying is not death — · it is release, a gift.  
The tree unburdened stands, · bare branches turned to bone.  

Bone-white the birches wait · for snow to wrap them clean.  
The ground collects the leaves · to blanket root and seed.  
What falls will rise again · when spring recalls the green.  
Gone is the summer blaze, · but sleeping is the gold.
