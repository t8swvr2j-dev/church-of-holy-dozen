# Holding

*A love poem — desire, presence, and the paradox of grasping*

---

Desire begins in dark, · a hand across the sheets.
The space between two breaths · before a name is called.
I trace the curve of you · beneath the window's glow.
Your warmth against my palm — · a boundary I hold.

Holding is not keeping, · love cannot be possessed.
The more I grasp for you, · the more you turn to air.

So I release my grip · and open both my hands.
You settle back to me · when I no longer reach.

Reaching yields to resting, · presence without demand.
Your body finds its shape · against the curve of mine.
We breathe a single breath, · we share a single heat.
The dark holds us like warmth — · here, touched, and still desired.
