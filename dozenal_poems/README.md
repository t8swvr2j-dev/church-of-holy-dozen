# Dozenal Poems

*Companion pieces to THE-DOZENAL-FORM.md — six poems showing the form's range*

---

Each poem follows all six rules of the Dozenal form:

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| I. The Dozen | Exactly 12 lines |
| II. The Factors | Three stanzas of four lines |
| III. The Half-Dozen | 12 syllables per line, caesura at 6 |
| IV. The Turn | Volta between lines 6 and 7 |
| V. The Return | Line 12 echoes/transforms Line 1 |
| VI. The Chain | Stanza-linking words that transform; circle closes |

**Total syllables per poem: 100z (144d) — one gross.**

The three exemplar poems in the spec (Psalm of the Pilgrim's Path, The Baker's Hands, What Remains) are not repeated here. These six extend the demonstration: from sacred hymn to personal confession, from nature meditation to protest, from meta-poetic inquiry to absurdist prayer.
