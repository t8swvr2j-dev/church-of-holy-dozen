# The Cage of Meter

*Pushing the form: can structure contain violence?*

---

Breaking comes at midnight, · and nothing breaks the same.
The glass explodes in arcs · that physics cannot trace.
A fist, a wall, a scream— · the room becomes a crime.
What's broken cannot heal— · this is an open wound.

Wounded, we learn to walk · around the shattered glass.
We map the floor by heart; · we know which boards will creak.

And yet the form contains— · twelve lines, twelve syllables.
The cage of meter holds · what chaos tries to spill.

Spilled ink, the poem still · refuses to run free.
Each word confined to count, · each break a measured breath.
Does structure heal the wound, · or trap what wants to scream?
Breaking comes at midnight— · remaking what it breaks.

*Line 7 breaks the fourth wall, naming the form's own constraints. The poem asks whether the Dozenal is healing or another kind of violence — and lets the question stand.*
