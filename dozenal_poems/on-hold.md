# On Hold

*A Dozenal of customer service — because if the form can carry prayer, it can carry the saxophone of corporate purgatory.*

---

Waiting is my life now — · the saxophone plays on.  
I called about a bill — · that was in early June.  
"Your call is important" — · the lie that loops like fate.  
My ear has fused with phone — · a ringing without end.  

Ended are my dreams now — · beneath the endless hold.  
The robot asks my name — · I have forgot it all.  

All grief becomes a prayer — · when language starts to fail.  
Press one, press two, press pound — · the catechism of wait.  

Waiting brings me closer — · I float above my rage.  
The menu cycles back — · I feel no pain at all.  
Enlightened by the hold — · I am the saxophone.  
The wait becomes my life — · or is my life the wait?
