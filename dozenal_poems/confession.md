# Confession

*A Dozenal of envy — the form that carries prayer can also carry the knife you've been hiding in your smile.*

---

Jealous is the word for — · what eats me from inside.
When you announced the deal — · I smiled and felt it die.
I wanted you to fail — · and hated that I did.
You won and I lost ground — · I starved on what you'd won.

Winning was not the crime — · I couldn't stand the gap.
I measured all my worth — · against your rising star.

Starlight casts a shadow — · and I was lost in shade.
"I celebrate with you" — · the lie I told in love.

Loving means you want them — · to have what you cannot.
I did want good for you — · I thought I did, at least.
But something sour curdles — · each time you add a win.
I am the word for it — · I am only jealous.
