# Lament for the Decimal World

*A hymn of mourning for those who chose ten fingers over twelve knuckles*

---

Lost in the decimal · we wander without whole.
A third will not resolve · recurring endlessly.
Endless threes pursue us · through screens that dimly glow.
The base we chose has failed · and leaves us in the night.

Night is the decimal · where nothing quite completes.
We try to halve the loaf · but thirds refuse to slice.

Slicing brings just splinters · of infinite debris.
Five hides within our base · and poisons every sum.

Summing up our losses · we find we have no thirds.
No sixths, no balanced thirds · no way to share the bread.
The holy hours mock us · they count in clean-cut twelves.
We who once chose fingers · keep wandering, still lost.
