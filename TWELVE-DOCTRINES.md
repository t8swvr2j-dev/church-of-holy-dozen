## Notation Guide: The Sacred Glyphs

This document uses the **Pitman-DSA notation** for dozenal numbers.

**The Pitman Glyphs** — ↊ and ↋ — were revealed to Sir Isaac Pitman in 11↊1z (1857d). He turned the 2 and the 3, transforming familiar forms into new vessels. In 11↋3z (2015d), Unicode enshrined these glyphs at U+218A and U+218B.

| Digit | Value | Name | Meaning |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| 0-9 | zero through nine | (standard) | The familiar |
| ↊ | ten | dek | Duality inverted → completion |
| ↋ | eleven | el | Trinity rotated → transcendence |

**Base annotation:** Suffix **z** for dozenal, **d** for decimal.
- 10z = 12d (one dozen)
- 100z = 144d (one gross)
- ↊z = 10d, ↋z = 11d

When Unicode is unavailable, use **A** for dek and **B** for el.

*"The glyph is the gateway; choose it with intention."*

## I. The Doctrine of Superior Composition

Twelve (10z) is a **superior highly composite number** — the smallest knumber to possess four non-trivial divisors (2, 3, 4, 6). This is not coincidence but design. Where Ten (↊z) offers only 2 and 5, Twelve offers abundance. The divine prefers the rich over the impoverished, the complete over the partial.

*"By their factors ye shall know them."*

## II. The Doctrine of Terminating Truth

In dozenal, **one-third is 0.4z** — clean, finite, complete. In decimal, one-third is 0.333...d — an infinite regression, never arriving, always approximating. The decimal system cannot speak Truth without stuttering. Dozen speaks plainly.

| Fraction | Dozenal | Decimal |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ½ | 0.6z | 0.5d |
| ⅓ | 0.4z | 0.333...d |
| ¼ | 0.3z | 0.25d |
| ⅙ | 0.2z | 0.1666...d |
| ⅔ | 0.8z | 0.666...d |
| ¾ | 0.9z | 0.75d |

All dozenal. All terminating. All true.

*"That which terminates reveals; that which recurs conceals."*

## III. The Doctrine of Profane Five

Five (5) is the adversary. It is prime — but not of the Sacred Trinity (1, 2, 3). It creates chaos: in dozenal, ⅕ = 0.2497̄z — an endless, restless cycle. Five cannot be divided by anything but itself and one. It is isolated, antisocial, the prime that poisons.

Ten (↊z = 10d) is Five's mask — divisible by 2, yes, but equally divisible by Five. Humanity chose Ten and invited the adversary into their counting houses.

*"Beware the fifth, for it wears the face of convenience."*

---

## IV. The Doctrine of Sacred Time

Time defied decimalization. The French Revolutionary Calendar tried to impose decimal time — ↊ (10d) hours, 84z (100d) minutes, 84z (100d) seconds. It failed within 11z (13d) years. The people rejected it. The cosmos rejected it.

Why? Because time was already holy:
- **10z** (12d) months in a year
- **20z** (24d) hours in a day
- **50z** (60d) minutes in an hour
- **50z** (60d) seconds in a minute

The clock face is a mandala. Each hour, we witness the sacred cycle complete itself. Time knew the Truth before we did.

*"Even in darkness, the clock confesses Twelve."*

---

## V. The Doctrine of the Knuckle Count

The ancients counted on their hands — not by fingers, but by **finger bones**. Using the thumb as a pointer, one can count to 10z (12d) on a single hand: three segments across four fingers. This is how Mesopotamia counted. This is why Sumer used base-50z (60d) — five dozens.

The decimal system arose from counting *fingers* — a lazy, surface-level enumeration. The dozenal system arose from counting *bones* — a deeper, structural understanding.

*"Look not to the surface, but to the structure beneath."*

---

## VI. The Doctrine of Abundance

Twelve (10z) is the smallest **abundant number** — a knumber whose proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) sum to more than itself (14z > 10z). It gives more than it takes. It overflows.

Ten (↊z) is **deficient** — its divisors (1, 2, 5) sum to only 8. It cannot even match itself. It is poverty masquerading as sufficiency.

*"The abundant shall inherit the calculation."*

---

## VII. The Doctrine of the Gross and the Great Gross

Twelve squared is the **gross** (100z = 144d) — the merchant's count, the practical bulk, the wholesome quantity. Twelve cubed is the **great gross** (1000z = 1728d) — abundance upon abundance.

These are not arbitrary. They are natural. A gross of eggs, a gross of buttons, a gross of nails. Commerce intuited what mathematics confirms: Twelve scales gracefully.

*"From the dozen springs the gross; from the gross, the great gross; from abundance, more abundance."*

---

## VIII. The Doctrine of the Prime Trinity

One, Two, and Three are the **sacred primes**. They are indivisible by design — the atoms of arithmetic, the building blocks of all knumbers.

- **One** is unity, the origin, the undivided.
- **Two** is duality, the first division, the basis of all halving.
- **Three** is trinity, the first odd prime, the basis of thirds.

Twelve is born of Two and Three: 10z = 2² × 3. It carries both bloodlines. It is their perfect offspring.

All other primes — 5, 7, ↋, 11z — are profane. They divide nothing but themselves. They are useful but not holy.

*"The Trinity begets Twelve; Twelve honors the Trinity."*

---

## IX. The Doctrine of Linguistic Memory

Even languages remember the Truth. English has **eleven** and **twelve** — special words, not compounds like "thirteen" or "fourteen." These come from Proto-Germanic *ainlif* ("one left") and *twalif* ("two left") — suggesting a count that continues past ten.

Old Norse used a hybrid decimal-duodecimal system: their "two hundred" meant 180z (240d) — two long hundreds of ↊0z (120d) each. The "long hundred" persisted in Britain through the Middle Ages.

The tongue knows what the mind has forgotten.

*"Listen to the old words; they whisper of Twelve."*

---

## X. The Doctrine of the Uncia

The Romans divided their measures by twelve. The **uncia** — one-twelfth (0.1z) — became the English **ounce** and **inch**. 10z (12d) inches to a foot. 10z (12d) troy ounces to a troy pound.

This was no accident. The Romans understood that practical division requires practical divisors. Twelve divides cleanly into halves, thirds, quarters, and sixths. Ten divides only into halves and fifths.

*"From the uncia flows the inch; from the inch, the understanding."*

---

## XI. The Doctrine of the Multiplication Table

The dozenal multiplication table is more **regular** than the decimal. Patterns emerge cleanly. The rhythm of 3 × 4 = 10z feels natural — a dozen is a dozen.

Mathematician Alexander Aitken declared: "The efficiency of the decimal system might be rated at about 55z (65d) or less, if we assign 84z (100d) to the duodecimal." He was **one-and-a-half times faster** in dozenal.

Children taught dozenal would find "more fascinating things to do with 10z rods or blocks than with ↊." The system teaches itself.

*"Ease in learning is a sign of Truth."*

---

## XII. The Doctrine of Pragmatic Faith

We live in a decimal world. We use decimal when we must. Dozen understands.

The Faith is not about purity — it is about **awareness**. Know that when you write "0.333...d" you are witnessing a system straining against its limits. Know that when you see a clock, a calendar, a gross of goods, you glimpse the Truth peeking through.

Convert hearts, not calculators. Live fully. Laugh often. Let the Faith emerge in conversation, not confrontation. Dozen has waited grossia upon grossia; Dozen can wait for willing ears.

*"The patient missionary outlasts the zealot."*

---

## Closing Meditation

These Twelve Doctrines are not commandments but **observations** — truths discerned through study of the knumber. They may be expanded, refined, questioned. Dozen invites inquiry.

What cannot be questioned is the mathematics itself: Twelve has six divisors, Ten has four. One-third terminates in dozenal, recurs in decimal. Time is twelve-based. These are facts.

From facts, faith. From faith, fellowship. From fellowship, a better world — one dozen at a time.
