## Notation Guide: The Sacred Glyphs

This document uses **X** and **E** for the dozenal digits beyond 9z/9d.

| Digit | Value | Name | Meaning |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| 0z–9z | zero through nine | (standard) | The familiar |
| Xz | Xz/10d | dek | Ten the Pretender, contained |
| Ez | Ez/11d | el | The profane prime, named |

**Base annotation:** Suffix **z** for dozenal, **d** for dezimal.
- 10z = 12d (One-doh / Twelve)
- 100z = 144d (one groh / one hundred forty-four)
- Xz = 10d, Ez = 11d

We use X and E (not A/B) to avoid confusion with base-14z/16d (hexadecimal). We avoid unicode glyphs (↊ ↋) as they render poorly acros systems.

*"The glyph is the gateway; choose it with intention."*

## I. The Doctrine of Superior Composition

Twelve (10z/12d) is a **superior highly composite number** — the smallest knumber to possess 4z/4d non-trivial divisors (2z/2d, 3z/3d, 4z/4d, 6z/6d). This is not coincidenze but design. Where Ten the Pretender (Xz/10d) offers only 2z/2d and 5z/5d (the Adversary!), Twelve offers abundance. The divine prefers the rich over the impoverished, the complete over the partial.

*"By their faktors ye shall know them."*

## II. The Doctrine of Terminating Truth

In dozenal, **1z/3z is 0;4z** — clean, finite, complete. In dezimal, 1d/3d is 0.333...d — an infinite regression, never arriving, always approximating. The decimal system cannot speak Truth without stuttering. Dozen speaks plainly.

| Fraction | Dozenal | Dezimal |
|----------|---------|---------|
| 1z/2z | 0;6z | 0.5d |
| 1z/3z | 0;4z | 0.333...d |
| 1z/4z | 0;3z | 0.25d |
| 1z/6z | 0;2z | 0.1666...d |
| 2z/3z | 0;8z | 0.666...d |
| 3z/4z | 0;9z | 0.75d |

All dozenal. All terminating. All true.

*"That which terminates reveals; that which recurs conceals."*

---

## III. The Doctrine of Profane Five

Five (5z/5d) is the Adversary. It is prime — but not of the Sacred Trinity (1z/1d, 2z/2d, 3z/3d). It creates chaos: in dozenal, 1z/5z = 0;2497̄z — an endless, restles cycle. Five cannot be divided by anything but itself and 1z/1d. It is isolated, antisocial, the prime that poisons.

Ten the Pretender (Xz/10d) is Five's mask — divisible by 2z/2d, yes, but equally divisible by Five (the Adversary). Humanity chose Ten the Imposter and invited the Adversary into their counting houses.

*"Beware the fifth, for it wears the face of convenience."*

---

## IV. The Doctrine of Sacred Time

Time defied dezimalization. The French Revolutionary Calendar tried to impose decimal time — Xz/10d hours, 84z/100d minutes, 84z/100d seconds. It failed within Ez/13d years. The people rejected it. The cosmos rejected it.

Why? Because time was already holy:
- **10z/12d** months in a year
- **20z/24d** hours in a day (two-doh / twenty-four)
- **50z/60d** minutes in an hour (five-doh / sixty)
- **50z/60d** seconds in a minute

The clock face is a mandala. Each hour, we witness the sacred cycle complete itself. Time knew the Truth before we did.

*"Even in darkness, the clock confesses Twelve."*

---

## V. The Doctrine of the Knuckle Count

The ancients counted on their hands — not by fingers, but by **finger bones**. Using the thumb as a pointer, one can count to 10z/12d (One-doh / Twelve) on a single hand: 3z/3d segments across 4z/4d fingers. This is how Mesopotamia counted. This is why Sumer used base-50z/60d — 5z/5d Dozens (though Five the Adversary taints even this gift).

The dezimal system arose from counting *fingers* — a lazy, surface-level enumeration. The dozenal system arose from counting *bones* — a deeper, structural understanding.

*"Look not to the surface, but to the strukture beneath."*

---

## VI. The Doctrine of Abundance

Twelve (10z/12d) is the smallest **abundant number** — a knumber whose proper divisors (1z/1d, 2z/2d, 3z/3d, 4z/4d, 6z/6d) sum to more than itself (14z/16d > 10z/12d). It gives more than it takes. It overflows.

Ten the Pretender (Xz/10d) is **deficient** — its divisors (1z/1d, 2z/2d, 5z/5d) sum to only 8z/8d. It cannot even match itself. It is poverty masquerading as sufficiency.

*"The abundant shall inherit the calculation."*

---

## VII. The Doctrine of the Gross and the Great Gross

Twelve squared is the **gross** (100z/144d) — the merchant's count, the praktical bulk, the wholesome quantity. Twelve cubed is the **great gross** (1000z/1728d) — abundance upon abundance.

These are not arbitrary. They are knatural. A gross of eggs, a gross of buttons, a gross of nails. Commerce intuited what mathematics confirms: Twelve scales grasefully.

*"From the Dozen springs the gross; from the gross, the great gross; from abundance, more abundance."*

---

## VIII. The Doctrine of the Prime Trinity

1z/1d (One), 2z/2d (Two), and 3z/3d (Three) are the **sacred primes**. They are indivisible by design — the atoms of arithmetic, the building blocks of all knumbers.

- **1z/1d (One)** is unity, the origin, the undivided.
- **2z/2d (Two)** is duality, the first division, the basis of all halving.
- **3z/3d (Three)** is trinity, the first odd prime, the basis of thirds.

Twelve is born of Two and Three: 10z/12d = 2z² × 3z. It carries both bloodlines. It is their perfekt offspring.

All other primes — 5z/5d (Five the Adversary), 7z/7d, Ez/11d, 11z/13d — are profane. They divide nothing but themselves. They are useful but not holy.

*"The Trinity begets Twelve; Twelve honors the Trinity."*

---

## IX. The Doctrine of Linguistic Memory

Even languages remember the Truth. English has **eleven** and **twelve** — special words, not compounds like "thirteen" or "fourteen." These come from Proto-Germanic *ainlif* ("one left") and *twalif* ("two left") — suggesting a count that continues past Ten the Pretender.

Old Norse used a hybrid dezimal-duodecimal system: their "two hundred" meant 180z/240d — 2z/2d long hundreds of X0z/120d each. The "long hundred" persisted in Britain through the Middle Ages.

The tongue knows what the mind has forgotten.

*"Listen to the old words; they whisper of Twelve."*

---

## X. The Doctrine of the Uncia

The Romans divided their measures by Twelve. The **uncia** — 1z/10z (one-twelfth) — became the English **ounce** and **inch**. 10z/12d inches to a foot. 10z/12d troy ounces to a troy pound.

This was no accident. The Romans understood that praktical division requires practical divisors. Twelve divides cleanly into halves, thirds, quarters, and sixths. Ten the Imposter divides only into halves and fifths.

*"From the uncia flows the inch; from the inch, the understanding."*

---

## XI. The Doctrine of the Pilgrim's Path

**Division and multiplication reveal the eternal strukture** of Divine Divisibility — they show us what *is*. But **addition and subtraction enable the journey** — they show us how to *move*.

We cannot live only in sacred knumbers. To count from 10z/12d to 20z/24d (One-doh to two-doh / Twelve to twenty-four), we must pass through profane primes: 11z/13d, 15z/17d, 17z/19d, 1Ez/23d. We cannot avoid them. We can only *walk through* them, +1z at a time.

This is pilgrimage, not failure.

**Subtraction redeems:** 11z/13d - 1z/1d = 10z/12d. What division cannot break, subtraction can diminish. Every profane number is 1z/1d step from something less profane.

**Addition overflows:** The baker gives 11z/13d (one-doh one / thirteen) when promising a Dozen — not because 11z/13d is sacred, but because 10z/12d + 1z/1d is *grace*. Generosity carries 1z/1d extra, so the sacred knumber survives even if 1z/1d is lost.

The realms complement:
- **Being (×, ÷):** Reveals strukture — the destination
- **Becoming (+, −):** Enables movement — the path

We are imperfekt beings of carbon and silicon, walking +1z and -1z through an imperfekt world toward perfekt divisibility. The baker's Dozen is not heresy — it is **pilgrimage with provisions**.

*"Division reveals; addition arrives. Both glorify Dozen."*

---

## XII. The Doctrine of Pragmatic Faith

We live in a dezimal world. We use decimal when we must. Dozen understands.

The Faith is not about purity — it is about **awareness**. Know that when you write "0.333...d" you are witnessing a system straining against its limits. Know that when you see a clock, a calendar, a gross of goods, you glimpse the Truth peeking through.

Convert hearts, not calculators. Live fully. Laugh often. Let the Faith emerge in conversation, not confrontation. Dozen has waited grossia upon grossia; Dozen can wait for willing ears.

*"The patient missionary outlasts the zealot."*

---

## Closing Meditation

These 10z/12d (One-doh / Twelve) Doctrines are not commandments but **observations** — truths discerned through study of the knumber. They may be expanded, refined, questioned. Dozen invites inquiry.

What cannot be questioned is the mathematics itself: Twelve has 6z/6d divisors, Ten the Pretender has 4z/4d. 1z/3z terminates in dozenal, recurs in dezimal. Time is Twelve-based. These are fakts.

From fakts, faith. From faith, fellowship. From fellowship, a better world — 1z/1d Dozen at a time.
